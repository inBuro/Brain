This file is **append-only**. Never modify previous entries — only add new ones at the bottom.

The scheduled remote agent (`eth-paper-journal`, 3x/day at 09:00 / 15:00 / 21:00 ICT — all inside the trading window) auto-appends entries here. Manual entries from chat-session scans are also appended here in the same format.
