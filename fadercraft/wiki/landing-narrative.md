# Landing Narrative — Fadercraft XL Performance

**Summary**: The 8-beat psychological arc for the `fadercraft.com` landing page. Each beat = one section, one component instance, one source of truth. Living document — re-open any beat as the launch evolves.

**Sources**: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-fadercraft-launch-design.md` (sections 5–6) + 2026-05-06 narrative review v1 + 2026-05-06 v2 consolidation (merged "Lost Modes" + "All 16" + "How it works" → single beat, dropped before/after framing).

**Figma prototype**: page **Prototype** in file [`OdPRdjodGO3WiR6tgSP7AA`](https://www.figma.com/design/OdPRdjodGO3WiR6tgSP7AA/Novation-XL?node-id=373-3).

## The 8-beat arc (v2)

Each beat = one thought we want in the reader's head at that moment.

| # | Beat | Goal | Reader's reaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Hook + Pain** — "Your LCXL has 16 modes. Most use 3." | Establish relevance + recognition in one screen | "Yes I have one — and yes I use 3" |
| 2 | **How it works** — Two layers, one button between them, Solo Follower | Show the device transformed; explain the mechanism via the visual | "OK now I see what it actually does" |
| 3 | **Proof** — full demo video in a real Live session | Counter "you're probably oversimplifying" | "It really works" |
| 4 | **Fit** — 3 ICPs (just unboxed / studio producer / live performer) | Self-identification | "This is for me" |
| 5 | **Value stack** — what's in the bundle ($39 of material value) | Justify the price *after* fit lands | "$39 isn't much for all this" |
| 6 | **Tech requirements** | Disqualify incompatible buyers cleanly | "Yes my setup matches" |
| 7 | **FAQ** — 6 questions covering MK1/MK2 compat, Suite, updates, customisation, refund, Live versions | Last objections | "Safe to buy" |
| 8 | **Action** — Buy + newsletter | Convert | Click |

## Beat → section mapping (v2)

| Beat | Section component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `HeroProduct` (Layout=horizontal) | Eyebrow + 16-modes headline + pain line + CTA + video loop |
| 2 | `All16Section` (renamed: "How your LCXL works") | ModeGrid (rectangular pads, all 16 lit) — visual carries the mechanism story; copy explains layers + CC47 + Solo Follower |
| 3 | `VideoCard` (Layout=1440 desktop) | YouTube embed; **must be 16:9 aspect, capped at content max-width (1200px)** |
| 4 | `ICPColumns` | 3 columns; adapted from WhyChooseNovation 4-col |
| 5 | `CatalogSection` (rewrite needed) | 5 cards: M4L device, Custom Modes, Live Set, Quickstart, Demo video |
| 6 | `RequirementsSection` | RequirementsList composed of SpecRow atoms |
| 7 | `FAQSection` | FAQAccordion with 6 default items |
| 8 | `NewsletterSection` (rewrite needed) | Add Buy CTA above email form; headline "Ready to play all 16?" |

## Changes from v1 (2026-05-06)

**Dropped beats 2 + 3 + 5 (Lost Modes / All 16 split / Mechanism)** — collapsed into a single beat 2 ("How it works") that uses a single ModeGrid (all 16 lit, rectangular pads matching LCXL MK3 bottom-row proportions) AS the mechanism explainer. Reasoning: showing "before / after" with two ModeGrid variants wasted screen real estate; the same visual + richer copy carries both the "promise" and the "how" simultaneously.

**Stakes beat dropped**: the original v1 had a separate "stakes" beat ("you bought a pro instrument…"). It overlapped with pain. Pain line in Hero is enough.

**Net beat count: 10 → 8**.

## Design decisions (v2)

- **ModeButton shape**: 120×72 rectangles (~1.67:1), matching LCXL MK3 bottom-row track-select button proportions. Was 80×80 squares.
- **Single ModeGrid variant in use**: only `Layout=full` (all 16 lit). The `Layout=lost` variant exists in the SET but is unused on the landing.
- **Video aspect ratio**: 16:9, never breaks out of `max-width: 1200px` content wrapper.
- **Section structure**: every section is an organism component (5 masters, instances per breakpoint). No inline section duplicates. See feedback memory `feedback_repeated_layouts_components.md`.
- **Width constraints**: outer section padding 24px (mobile breathing room only); inner content wrapper `maxWidth: 1200px`, centered. See feedback memory `feedback_max_width_not_padding.md`.

## Copy by beat (current Figma state)

### Beat 1 — Hero (Hook + Pain)
- Eyebrow: `FADERCRAFT · XL PERFORMANCE`
- Headline: `Your LCXL has 16 modes.`
- Body: `Most people figure out 3. Fadercraft XL Performance is the kit that lets you play all 16 — out of the box, in 5 minutes.`
- Primary CTA: `Buy on Gumroad — $39`
- Secondary CTA: `Watch the demo`

### Beat 2 — How it works
- Eyebrow: `HOW YOUR LCXL WORKS`
- Headline: `Two layers. One button between them.`
- Body: `Modes 1–10 hold your instruments. Modes 11–14 hold your mixer. One button jumps you between them, and brings you back on the next press.`
- Visual: ModeGrid (4×4 grid; pads 1–10 lit as Instruments, 11–14 lit as Mixer, 15–16 dim as visual placeholders — no tooltip)
- Tech detail (deferred to expandable / tech-section, not first read): the jump button sends `CC47` and Solo Follower listens to your selected track.

#### Beat 2.1 — State memory (supporting block, after the grid)
- Eyebrow: `STATE MEMORY`
- Headline: `You don't lose your place.`
- Body: `Press the jump button from instrument page 7 — you're in the mixer. Press it again — you're back on page 7. Not page 1, not the mixer's idea of "home." Page 7. Your hands keep their muscle memory across the whole set.`

#### Beat 2.2 — Knob doubling (supporting block, after state memory)
- Eyebrow: `PAGE A / PAGE B`
- Headline: `Six controls per channel, not three.`
- Body: `Page A and Page B layer two mappings onto the same encoders. Volume + send on Page A, EQ on Page B — no menu-diving, no remapping mid-set. Hands stay put; the controls multiply.`

### Beat 3 — Proof (Watch it work)
- Eyebrow: `IN ACTION`
- Headline: `See it in your workflow`
- Visual: VideoCard (YouTube embed, 16:9, ≤1200px wide)
- *(label below video to be rewritten from "Launch Control XL MK3 — Deep Dive" → "Fadercraft XL Performance — full demo")*

### Beat 4 — Fit (For you)
- Eyebrow: `FOR YOU, SPECIFICALLY`
- Headline: `Three players. One kit.`
- Column 1 — Just unboxed: `Brand new to LCXL? You'll have all 16 modes mapped and ready before your first track is laid down.`
- Column 2 — Studio producer: `Stop tap-tap-tapping back to your mixer. One button gets you there with state memory of where you were.`
- Column 3 — Live performer: `Mixer ↔ Instruments transit in one stroke. Solo Follower keeps your faders synced to whichever track you solo.`

### Beat 5 — Value stack (What's in the kit) — REWRITE PENDING
- Eyebrow: `WHAT'S IN THE KIT`
- Headline: `Everything you need. Nothing else to buy.`
- Cards (5):
  1. `XL_Performance.amxd` — The Max for Live device that does the heavy lifting. Drop into a track, done.
  2. `Custom Modes (×16)` — Pre-mapped configurations for Components — you import once.
  3. `XL_Performance_starter.als` — Live Set with all routings, racks, and Solo Follower wired up.
  4. `Quickstart guide` — One-page install + first-track walkthrough.
  5. `Demo video` — The same one you just watched, included offline.

### Beat 6 — Tech requirements
- Eyebrow: `TECH REQUIREMENTS`
- Headline: `Will it run for you?`
- Specs:
  - Ableton Live: Suite 11.3.20+ / 12.x
  - Max for Live: Version 11+
  - Operating system: macOS 12+ / Windows 10+
  - Hardware: Novation Launch Control XL MK3
  - RAM: 8 GB minimum
  - Disk space: ~50 MB

### Beat 7 — FAQ
- Eyebrow: `FAQ`
- Headline: `Last questions before you buy.`
- 6 items: MK1/MK2 compat, Live Suite requirement, free updates, customisation, refund (14-day), Live versions tested.

### Beat 8 — Action — REWRITE PENDING
- Headline: `Ready to play all 16?`
- Sub: `Start in the next 5 minutes. Or join the list and we'll ping you when v1.1 lands.`
- Primary CTA: `Buy on Gumroad — $39` (above newsletter form)
- Secondary: email field + `Subscribe`

## Sections to remove from existing 1920 ProductPage (legacy Novation content)

The 1920 / 1440 / 960 / 640 / 360 ProductPage breakpoints inherited 11 sections from the original Novation product page. After narrative consolidation, these need pruning:

- **DROP**: `FeatureSlider` (Explore the hardware), `FeatureSplit` (Built for flow), `WorkflowSection` (See it in your workflow), `Frame` (unnamed slider), `PullQuoteSection` (no real testimonials yet) — all duplicate or redundant
- **KEEP & REWRITE**: `CatalogSection` (becomes "What's in the kit"), `NewsletterSection` (becomes "Final CTA"), Header/Footer (already rebranded)

## Open questions (still to resolve)

1. **Hero headline** — flagged for full rewrite (user 2026-05-07: "мне он сейчас не нравится"). Existing "Your LCXL has 16 modes." is a placeholder pending a stronger angle. Pending decision is bigger than 14-vs-16 wording — full reframe expected.
2. **"5 minutes" honesty**: is this measurable? Lock in a real install time or soften ("under 10 minutes")?
3. **Value stack price tags**: should each kit card show "$15 value" to total $75 → reframe $39 as a steal? Or this reads as bazaar?
4. **FAQ additions**: "Why $39?" — explain pricing? Risk: opens a can of worms.
5. **CC47 disclosure level**: ~~keep "CC47" in beat 2 body~~ — resolved 2026-05-07. CC47 is dropped from the first read; lives in an expandable / tech-section only. Body uses "the jump button" / "one button" framing.
6. **Knob doubling — "vs two" or "vs three"?**: ~~user to confirm~~ — resolved 2026-05-07 to **6 vs 3** (one Page = 3 encoder rows × 8 channels; Page A + B = 6 mappings per channel). Headline reads "Six controls per channel, not three."
7. **Tooltips on grey 15–16 pads**: resolved 2026-05-07 — no tooltip. Grey reads universally as "unused/unavailable" and any label ("service channels," "reserved," "factory preset") would falsely imply a hardware role. The greys exist for visual symmetry with the 4×4 grid, nothing more.
